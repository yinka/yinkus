No, it's not a car.

It's the Mac Pro wheels kit, on sale for the unfortunates who didn't configure this option during their [Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac-pro/) purchase.

> Put your Mac Pro on wheels with the Mac Pro Wheels Kit. The custom-designed stainless steel and rubber wheels make it easy to move your Mac Pro around, whether sliding it out from under your desk or across your studio.
