Thomas Alsop, 21, brick labourer, was convicted in 1833 at Staffordshire for stealing a sheep.

> Accept this dear mother from your unfortunate son Thomas-Alsop, transported July 25 aged 21, 1833. 
  When you see this think of me, forget me not, dear mother.

I first saw one of these at my local museum and became fascinated. The National Museum of Australia has 314 of these `convict love tokens` in its collection. 

Convicts who were transported to Australia from England (in the 1800's) could not be expected to return, they engraved messages on copper pennies, known as `leaden hearts` and smuggled them out to their families. Convicts could be sentenced to transportation for 7 years, 14 years or life - some for stealing as little as an handkerchief.

## Edward

> No pen can write, no tongue can tell, the aching heart, that bids farewell.
