So it would appear that AMD have revealed the <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~86164,00.html" title="Read the press release on AMD's website">new</a> <a href="http://www.theregister.com/2004/06/07/amd_sempron/" title="Read the article posted on 'The Register'">name</a> for it's new value market processor.

It now sounds like a brand of tampon as opposed to a brand of condom.

If it's as good as the Duron was, despite the name, then it should be a good chip.
